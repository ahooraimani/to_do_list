# To-Do List in Python 📝
This is a simple command-line to-do list application written in Python.  
It allows users to:
- Add/remove tasks
- View all tasks
- Assign priorities beside each task
- Save/load tasks from a file
-----------------------------------------------------------
## 📂 How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.  
Run the script using:

```bash
python to_do_list.py
```
-----------------------------------------------------------
##  What I learned
- Python basics (input/output, loops, conditionals)
- File handling
- Object-oriented programming
-----------------------------------------------------------
## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add GUI (with Tkinter or PyQt)
- Add due dates and reminders
- Turn it into a web app (Flask or Django)
- Add support for marking each task as either completed or pending
- Add functionality to assign a deadline date to tasks
- Add functionality to sort the task list according to the priority assigned to each task
